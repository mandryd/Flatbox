     - This is an example, I ordered mine from bolt depot

**Instructions**
- the brass heatsets are melted into the lid holes.
- m3x6 button heads.  short button head screws are needed due to how thin the flatbox is.  
- as long as your printer can bridge short distances you shouldn't need to use supports.
- note the upper lid face flex button things were also reshaped to be less square.  This was just a personal preference.
